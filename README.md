# Hasteroids
A Classic Asteroids game, written in haskell with openGL libraries.

### Dependencies:

 - OpenGL, GLUT
 - stack is optional, but recommended (latest)
 - ghc v8.0.2
 - if using stack, be sure to ```stack install OpenGL GLUT```as stack keeps dependencies isolated from system-level packages.

### Running the game:

  - `$ cd ~/{your-clone-root}/Hasteroids`
  
  - `$ stack ghc -- --make main.hs`

  - `$ ./main`
